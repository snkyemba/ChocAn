        <h2>Coupling and Cohesion Paragraph</h2>
        <p> There is high coupling between each of the controllers and their respective views. Because each controller has a direct dependence on their respective view, any change to the view would mean a corresponding change to the controller is needed. This issue makes the system difficult to maintain and update. On the cohesion end, there are also several issues. By having certain classes, such as the ReportController class, complete multiple tasks, such as generate reports as well as update the view, forces the classes to have multiple types of functionality which makes it difficult to maintain and reason about. By having separated classes that would work together, one to generate reports and the other to update views, there is more cohesion and abstraction, which make the software easier to maintain and update. Regardless of these problems, the design for the software has relatively low coupling and high cohesion, which makes it so that the software designers, us, will have an easier time in maintaining and evolving the software to adhere with whatever problems arise, either through what the customer requests, or through our own observance. We believe that an architecture that could work effectively in this scenario would be the “layered architecture”, as outlined in “An Introduction to Software Architecture”. We propose that the software could be split into three separate layers, the Presentation Layer, which includes the terminals, the Application Layer, which includes the controllers, and finally the Direct Access Layer, which is composed of the data classes.The layered architecture proposed includes several benefits, including a reduced coupling, as each layer is loosely coupled, increased cohesion, as each layer has specific and singular responsibility, and reusability, as these layers can be reused in similar projects. For these reasons, we believe that layered architecture is the most applicable architecture for our design.
