      <td>Description</td>
      <td>The ChocAn database and system needs to be able to be restored or recreated at request. A failure may occur due to a fault, failure, user error, or a malicious act. ChocAn's systems and configurations could be recreated using deployment packages. Since the information contained within the ChocAn database is vital to business operation, data must be stored in a way that allows for backups to be created and data must be able to be restored in a consistent manner. However, due to medical privacy laws, information may need to be removed from ChocAn databases upon request, necesitating that data can be easily removed from backups.

Since we have been contracted by ChocAn, we don't need a sales team to sell our product to ChocAn. However, we do need to make sure ChocAn doesn't change their mind about our company due to lacking security. We need to show that our collection of personal data is secure, despite transferring some of it over a network.</td>
