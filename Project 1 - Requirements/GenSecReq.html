      <td>As a company, we need to show that we are not using personal data inapropriately, especially since this will be used in healthcare and there are federal laws, such as HIPPA, to follow. Since we have been contracted by ChocAn, we don't need a sales team to sell our product to ChocAn. However, we do need to make sure ChocAn doesn't change their mind about our company due to lacking security. We need to show that our collection of personal data is secure, despite transferring some of it over a network.</td>
